# Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline on Heart Disease UCI Dataset

This project analyzes and predicts heart disease using a full ML pipeline: data preprocessing, PCA, feature selection, supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM), and evaluation metrics.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
2. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Supervised Learning Models
5. Unsupervised Learning
6. Model Evaluation  

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab and run all cells step-by-step.
